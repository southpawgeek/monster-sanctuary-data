The Warlock's Toad, as it is sometimes called, was associated with the misty swamps and the mysterious, forlorn places within the deepest reaches of the wilds where humans fear to tread. Finding the Warlock's Toad was said to be a perilous journey, but one which might reward the aspiring wizard with arcane secrets.",

Their thick, unruly fur mainly serves the purposes of heat insulation and protection against the elements, allowing them to adapt to all types of different environments. Their ancient fossils can be found all across the world, including the snowy arctic and the vast blazing deserts. Their exoskeletons are extremely tough, but they don't grow with their wearers - meaning a Ucan has to shed its exoskeleton several times in its life and grow a new one each time.",

Argiopes spread tiny invisible threads throughout their territories that alert them of any trespasser. Once alerted, Argiopes will silently stalk their target and ambush them at just the right moment. They possess small wing-like limbs on their back, which allow them to redirect their jumps in mid-air. Thanks to this ability, as well as their excellent vision and split-second reactions, it's almost impossible to escape from an Argiope. If need be, Argiopes can also throw their webs like a net to immobilize their foes."

Other Polterofens, on the other hand, only turn alive after their owners have moved to another house. Left behind, those Polterofens become filled with grief and sometimes set out to find their original owners."

According to ancient stories, Sutsune are able to transform into common foxes or young women; only upon closer inspection one might spot some deformities, such as horns hidden underneath the hair or fur. Often, however, it was already too late at that point, since the Sutsune already snuck in close enough to fulfill her nefarious plan. A Sutsune is said to be as likely to kill as she is to enthrall a man's heart so as to subjugate him for her purposes."

However, interrupting their \"operations\" or attempting to capture them will provoke them to attack with magic, which curses and interrupts the biological functions of living creatures. Their cures sometimes resemble ominous experiments - for instance, they might save a human's life, but at the price of their legs. Conversely, sometimes they add enhancements to their patient's bodies, such as additional limbs or wings, but neglect to treat their illnesses. Thankfully, when raised by Keepers, they do not practice such behavior."
