Their thick, unruly fur mainly serves the purposes of heat insulation and protection against the elements, allowing them to adapt to all types of different environments. Their ancient fossils can be found all across the world, including the snowy arctic and the vast blazing deserts. Their exoskeletons are extremely tough, but they don't grow with their wearers - meaning a Ucan has to shed its exoskeleton several times in its life and grow a new one each time."

Once alerted, Argiopes will silently stalk their target and ambush them at just the right moment. They possess small wing-like limbs on their back, which allow them to redirect their jumps in mid-air. Thanks to this ability, as well as their excellent vision and split-second reactions, it's almost impossible to escape from an Argiope.

It can coat its hook-like arms with a powerful corroding acid to eat away at its foe's defenses as well as swiftly dig through the earth. More surprisingly, a Darnation is also capable of producing volatile compounds that create powerful short range explosions, which often catch prey or would-be predators off-guard."
